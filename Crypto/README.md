## RSA  
### [Wiener attack](./wiener_RSA.py)  
Given n and e, if d is small we can find it fast with continued fractions.  

### [Boneh-durfee](./boneh-durfee.sage)
Given n and e, if d < N^0.292 we can find it using LLL and these cool polynomial stuff they always use.  

### [Factor n given d](./factorNGivenD.py)
Given n, e and d, find p and q.

### [Curveball](./curveball_RSA.gp)  
Find p, q to sign given message and crypted  

### [Common modulus](./rsa_commonmodulus.py)
Find message given cyphers with public exponents not coprimes beetween them.

### [Weak prime factorizarion](./weak_prime.sage)
When p can be represented as a\*p = u0 + M_1\*u_1 + ... + M_k\*u_k with small p, M_i > 0 for 1 <= i <= k. To understand better read [this paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/398.pdf).

## AES  
### [ECB classical input + flag](./solve_ecb.py)

## [Hill cipher](./hill.py)
Matrix K is Key, vector P is PlainText, C is the CipherText, so we have  
C = K*P mod 26  
P = inverse(K)*C mod 26  

## [Linear congruential Generator](./lcg.py)  
Given states X of formula  
X[n] = aX[n-1] + c (mod m)  
find m(4 states+), a(3 states+) and c(2 states+)

## [MPKC from Chen et al.â€™s Encryption Scheme (2020)](./mpkc_chen.sage)
Attack is based on [this paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/053.pdf).  

## ECDSA

### [biased k attack + repeated nonce attack](./ecdsa.sage)

## [XOR Functions](./xor.py)
